## Development server

## Build

## Note

To use OBS, make sure that the obs websocket port is connected to 4455 from the obs settings.

## General Use

1 - You can switch between obs pages.
2 - You can remotely manage applications that require Discord or any keyboard combination.

For example: Let the Discord mute key be shift + home keys. After defining these combinations in a box in the settings menu, all you have to do is just click on the Remote page.
The rest of the settings are just up to you.
